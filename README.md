# Assuremint - Static Website (Ready to Deploy)

This is a minimal static website for **Assuremint** (real estate & insurance brokerage).
Files:
- index.html
- css/styles.css

## How to deploy

### Option A: Deploy to Vercel (recommended)
1. Create a GitHub repo and push these files (or upload zip).
2. Sign up at Vercel and click *New Project* -> Import Git Repository.
3. Select the repo and deploy. (No build step needed for plain static site.)

### Option B: GitHub Pages
1. Create a GitHub repo and push files to `main`.
2. Go to repo Settings -> Pages -> Source: `main` branch / `/ (root)`.
3. Save â€” your site will publish at `https://<username>.github.io/<repo>`.

### Quick upload (without git)
- You can upload files directly to GitHub using the web UI:
  - Create a new repo, click "Add file" -> "Upload files", and drag the files in.
  - Commit and then deploy with Vercel or GitHub Pages.
